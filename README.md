# Here are three features of the Mi-8 website project:

# Responsive Design for All Devices:
Ensuring that the website is responsive across various devices, including desktop, mobile, and tablet views. This means that the website's layout and content should adapt and look good on different screen sizes and orientations. 
# Dynamic Donation Details Page:
 When a user clicks on a donation card, they should be redirected to a page that displays detailed information about that particular donation. This dynamic page should include elements such as the donation's picture, title, description, and a "Donate" button with the associated price. Additionally, a toast or sweet alert should be displayed upon clicking the "Donate" button, providing meaningful success feedback to the user.

# Pie Chart on the Statistics Page:
 This pie chart should visually represent the user's donations against the total donations, showing the percentage of the user's contributions. This feature adds a graphical element to the website and provides users with an easily understandable overview of their donation statistics.
